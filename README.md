# Multi API in One Folder - Node.js Project

This project demonstrates how to handle **multiple APIs using different routers** in a single Node.js application.  
Each router represents a separate API module (for example: Students, Colleges, Teachers, etc.), all connected to the same Express server.

## 🚀 Features
- Multiple routers in one project  
- CRUD operations for different entities  
- Local JSON/array data storage (like local variables)  
- Clean modular project structure  
- Express.js based RESTful APIs

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Node.js  
- Express.js  
- Postman (for testing)  

*(Can be easily upgraded to use databases like MySQL or Firebase)*

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AmritaEdugaon/Multiapi_in_1folder.git
